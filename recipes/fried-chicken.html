      <li>
        Wash chicken and pat dry.
        In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder, 
        onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. 
        Place chicken in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate 
        at least 8 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. 
        Drain chicken in a colander to remove excess buttermilk. 
        Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. 
        Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with 
        tempura batter mix. 
        Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. 
        Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until 
        browned on all sides.
