  <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup greated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic 
        (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.
        Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet 
        to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with 
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in 
        a separate bowl, set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken 
        breasts, evenly coating both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer 
        breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into 
        both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 
        10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high 
        heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot 
        oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken 
        will finish cooking in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 
        2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with 
        equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone
        cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle 
        each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly 
        and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 
        15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
        the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
